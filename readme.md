movie-browser
=============

This is a simple sinatra app I build to allow my media server to make my movie library available over LAN. Eventually, it will behave like Netflix, allowing users to browse the contents of the server by genre/actor/director/studio/year/etc and watch them all through an HTML5 video player.

usage

Probably don't. If you want something like this, you're welcome of course to use mine as an example, but it's pretty deeply tied in to the way my media server works already.
